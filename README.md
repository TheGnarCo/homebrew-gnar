## The Gnar-CLI Homebrew Formula

This repo is for making the [Gnar-CLI](https://github.com/TheGnarCo/gnar-cli) tool widely available on the [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) Package Manager.

### install

```
brew tap thegnarco/gnar
brew install gnar
```

### Note

It seems like VSCode adds some things to NODE_OPTIONS that currently interrupt the operation of the gem within the VSCode terminal. Investigating ways to fix it!
